# Esper™

## What is Project Esper™?
Project Esper™ (Working Title) is a Javascript library that is used to make interactive, real-time Web sites and Web Applications. It's focus is on providing features that make the users end goal easier but also remaining simple and easy to use. Esper focuses on trying to be easy while not being over-engineered.

## Why did you create Project Esper™?
I've used a myriad of other libraries both in Ayphix and at my day job. Most of them are over-engineered and or are cumbersome to use. I wanted to create a system that I could easily integrate into my own systems while being easy to setup and use. The other thing is that I love ES6 and I wanted to create a system compatible with that.

## What was Project Esper™ Created in?
Project Esper™ is written entirely JavaScript right now although I will probably include some CSS files and eventually I'll have some examples on integrating with php and other back-end languages. Esper was written in ES6 and transpiled into EM3 to support the widest array of browsers possible. Although I did include the ES6 file incase you dont want to support older browsers and want to take part in the awesome features that the library does through ES6 (Or you could transpile your own code into EM3 ;) ).

## What is this system licensed under?
MIT

## Can I contribute to this awesome project?
Absolutely, but I will only accept code in my own style and I will review everything before I accept it to be sure things work right and stay in-line with the focus and goals of the project.

## What is your style?
Look at the code in the "espada.es6.js" file, but tl;dr; is I put braces on the same line as the declarations and variable use under_score_style = "";.

## Why are you so up-tight about contribution?
Look at similar libraries and compare them to Esper, thats why.

## I want to try it but I dont want to download the whole package
Thats cool, I've setup a simple CDN on my site with Esper on it, I update it as I finish new features so don't worry about it breaking.

You COULD also try the working version but that version may break as I work on it.
